🧠 UiPath Data Entry Bot
This is a UiPath-powered automation bot I developed to handle repetitive data entry tasks. As part of my job,
I was required to manually enter data into over 1200 forms, which was time-consuming and exhausting. To solve this,
I built this bot to automate the process and improve efficiency.

✅ Features
Automates the entry of form data with high accuracy.

Saves time and reduces human error.

Works seamlessly on structured input formats.

🔧 Work in Progress
While the bot works well, I’m currently working on:

Adding exception handling for better reliability.

Improving error logging and recovery.

Enhancing user input flexibility.

Adding a user-friendly configuration setup.

🚀 Future Plans

Integrate email or notification alerts for failed entries.

🙏 Thank You!
Thanks for checking out this project!
Feel free to try it out, leave feedback, or suggest improvements.
I’m always looking to make this bot more powerful and user-friendly.
